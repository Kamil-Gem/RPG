# RPG
RPG Project - created just for fun over the course of around a month.

Controls:
WASD - movement |
Q - save the map to JSON |
P - load the map saved in JSON

Key:
_ - Empty space |
C - Coin |
[int] - This many coins required (also loads a new map when successfully used) |
P - The player; you.

I am aware the code is not great. This was my first time making a project of this scale.
